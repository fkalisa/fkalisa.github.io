I had an interesting workshop on basic of professional communication. The takeaways were :


<ul>

<li> Accept an information if only it is <b>true</b>, <b>good</b> and <b>useful</b>.</li>
<li> When a someone is challenged in the wrong way (for example an employee asking to a manager if his request is an order
in front of everyone). The manager should not take it personally but he should respond using the <b>"We approach"</b>.
<div>
 example :  <b>We </b> have the responsibility to achieve this goal and  <b>we </b> would like to count on you!
 </div>
</li>

<li>In any organisation, <b>TRUST </b> is important.</li>
<li>Good communication goes with understanding the  <b>positive </b> inner state. </li>
<li><b>Manage change </b> is about adapting and adjusting.  </li>
<li> <b>Eye contact </b> is important during conversation and is part of building trust. </li>


</ul>
