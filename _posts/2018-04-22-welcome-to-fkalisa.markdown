Hi Everyone,

Welcome to my space where I will be sharing what I am up to. As a software engineer, this space will be about software
development practices (brown bags, conferences, tutorials, coding dojo, books, projects ...)
as well as miscellaneous adventures I will come across (travels, events, meetups, ... ).

<!--more-->

Since january 2018, I have taken some resolutions which are :

<ul>
<li> Take my OCP 8 certification</li>
<li> Travel abroad once a year for vocation (while abroad, I would like to volunteer one day and attend a JUG).
This will be an opportunity to connect with new people and share the experience on this space.
</li>
<li> Be knowledgeable in Angular </li>
<li> Renew my membership as a toastmaster</li>
<li> Understand how startups are created and funded</li>
</ul>

Girls and Guys, wish me good luck!
</p>
